For Linked List , following are the basic to advanced things will be done : 

singly linked list : 
1. creation and traversal 
2. insertion at start and end 

INITIALIZATION : 
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self , value):
          self.next = None
          self.value = value

head = LinkedList(1)
print(f"{head.value})

output: 1 

doubly linked list : 
1. creation and traversal 
2. insertion at start and end
