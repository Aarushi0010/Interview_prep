Last In First Out

Push - adding an element to stack 
Pop - removing an element from stack 
Peek - to check/read which element is at top
Size - number of elements in stack 

Note - initially the value of top variable is set to -1

stack overflow - condition when stack is completely full to its size 
stack underflow - condition when stack has no element 

pop function - will accept element value as argument 
push function - won't accept argument as always the last element is popped

peek - returns element (last for stack , depends for queue)
isFull - return bool value , to check if stack/queue are full
