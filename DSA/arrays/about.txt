It stores data items or there references in contiguous memory locations . 
Has following benefits over other data structure : 

1. Random Access : using indices of the array items 
2. Cache Friendliness : as contiguous memory allocation , so locality of references

It is a LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE 

Basic terminologies :
