A linear data structure, following FIFO principle 

Terminologies:
1. Front / Head: position of entry in a queue ready to be served, he first entry that will be removed from the queue
2. Rear / Tail: Position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added
3. Size : refers to the current number of elements in the queue.
4. Capacity : refers to the maximum number of elements the queue can hold.

Operations: 
1. Enqueue : Addition of element to queue
changes - shift rear to next position and add element at rear

2. Dequeue : Remove element from queue
changes - remove element at front and shift front to next pointer

3. Peek/Front : return front element

4. Size : number of elements returned

5. isFull / isEmpty

Applications:
1. Used as buffer when speed of producer and consumer mismatched. Ex: Keyboard and CPU
2. Used when we have single resource and multiple users. Ex: cpu and multiple processes
3. In algorithm techniques like BFS or Topological sort,etc.
