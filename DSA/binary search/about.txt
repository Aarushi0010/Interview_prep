Binary Search : 

It is a search algorithm used to find the position of the target element within  SORTED ARRAY . 
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or 
the interval is empty. The search interval is halved by comparing the target element with the 
middle value of the search space.

The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the 
time complexity to O(log N). 

conditions for binary search : 
1. The array must be sorted in ascending or descending order.
2. Access to any element of the data structure should take constant time.

step-by-step guide : 

Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index “mid”. 
Compare the middle element of the search space with the key. 
1. If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.
2. If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.
3. If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.
3. If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.
This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.

2 ways for binary search : 

1. Iterative approach 
2. Recursive approach
